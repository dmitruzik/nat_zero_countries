According to recent data we analyzed, we can describe the folowing statuses:

In Law
This status indicates that the country has legally adopted its zero-emission pledge. It is now enforceable by law and mandates actions to achieve net-zero emissions by the target year. These commitments are binding and typically outlined in national legislation or government regulations. Example:

If a country has a law stating it must achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, it is classified as "In Law." Importance:

The strongest form of commitment. Reflects high accountability, as failing to meet the target could have legal consequences for the government or relevant parties. These countries are: Sweden, france, Denmark, New Zeland.

In Policy Document Meaning:
This status signifies that the zero-emission pledge is included in official government policies, plans, or strategy documents but is not yet legally binding. These documents guide action but do not have the force of law. Example:

A country might publish a "National Climate Action Plan" outlining goals to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, but it remains non-binding unless formalized into law. Importance:

A step toward implementation but lacks enforceability. Demonstrates intention and planning but may be subject to changes or delays.

These countries are: Finland, Austria, Iceland, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Portugal, Costa Rica, Marshal Island.

Proposed Legislation Meaning:
Indicates that the government is in the process of introducing legal measures to formalize the zero-emission pledge. A draft bill or proposal has been presented to the legislature but has not yet been passed into law. Example:

A government proposes a bill to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, but it is still under discussion or awaiting approval. Importance:

Represents an intention to transition from planning to legal commitment. May face political hurdles or opposition, which can delay or derail the process.

And only 2 countries are in the status of negative emission. These countries are: Bhutan and Suriname.

As we can see on this chart, 12 countries are in the range of target years 2046-2050. It means that it will take more time to successfully implement the zero-emission pledge. 2 countries are in the range of target years 2035-2040. And only 1 country is in the range of target years 2041-2045.
